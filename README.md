Cuisine Forms - User-centered form builder

Forms are the driving part of interaction on the web. So you might say they are kind of important to do well. With Cuisine Forms you can easily create forms via the WordPress admin, like you’re used to or use Cuisine Core’s field-engine to generate a form from code. It saves entries, defaults SMTP-sending and has a top-notch frontend UI with inline validation and instant feedback.
